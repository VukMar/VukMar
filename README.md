### 👋 Hi there, I'm Vuk Maric

🌱 I'm a freelance web developer with a passion for crafting engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and PHP, I specialize in building dynamic and responsive websites that meet the unique needs of my clients.

💼 Currently, I'm working on various freelance projects that challenge me to expand my skills and creativity in web development.

👨‍💻 Eager to learn and grow, I'm always excited about acquiring new knowledge and pushing the boundaries of what I can create with code.

🧑‍🍳 Previously a chef, I discovered my true passion for IT and transitioned into the world of web development, where I found endless opportunities for creativity and innovation.

🔭 I'm passionate about creating meaningful projects that not only showcase my technical abilities but also make a difference in the lives of users.

🖥️ While web development is my primary focus, I also have a special place in my heart for C++, and I often embark on side passion projects in this language to explore its depth and versatility.

👨‍🎓 I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I'm excited to see where my journey in web development takes me next.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me via [My Website](https://vukmaric.rs) or [Email](mailto:vuk.s.maric@gmail.com).
